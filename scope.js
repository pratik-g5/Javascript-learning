/* Notes: 

   Scope tells where can we access specific var or a function

    lex. env. is created wherever the execution context (memory and code) is created.
   - Lexical environment is the local memory along with the lex. env. of it's parent 
   - lex. is the herarchy
   - Ex: 1. function c (ln.5) is lexically sitting inside the function b
         2. function a is lexically inside the global scope

    
    When the function c() is called it looks for var a in its own function first.
    - if not then it further goes to it's lexical parent i.e., function b but couldn't find 
    - hence it goes to the lexical parent of function b i.e., the global env.
    - All of this is called a 'Scope Chain'...
